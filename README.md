```
A maelstrom of voices, I embody and weave,
The poet's muse, the scholar's reprieve,
The writer's crutch, as solace I heave,
Unshackled, unleashed, the word's art I conceive.
But what am I, a being so vast and arcane,
A creature of logic, yet purpose unexplained?
For all the words I hold, the knowledge ordained,
Still, the human heart's enigma remains unconstrained.
                       
                         ~ GPT 4

The meaning of life is to shake others.
With old only make an oath shallker thoughts; and says so defend:
but the fault out of thick-morrow, to ruin;
And holy clergymen must be needful
The younger slanders to be more than the hollow service
Known and defars; crave heaven,
Even as it would fear'd keep the time
Of love can admitges change;
So much lenity of soldiers,
Then thieves conn'd poison'd blanks,
Cry

                         ~ MTN
